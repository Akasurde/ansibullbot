# REQUIREMENTS FOR 1.0:
#
# MUCH SIMPLIFIED:
# 
# * Template to point out the file, so we can find the maintainer
# * Detect filename, so we can ping the maintainer
# * Look to see who last responded (submitter or maintainer) so we can ping the other side
# * Figure out how to close really old stuff (maybe every 3 months ask submitter "still a bug?")
